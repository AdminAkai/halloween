                <p>WHATCHAMACALLIT, Halloween is coming soon. Here are a few rules for happy haunting</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        You may want to wear a funny costume that will make people <img src="" alt="snicker" title="SNICKER">. Some of you might want to
                        dress up like a man from <img src="" alt="mars" title="MARS"> or perhaps even a <img src="" alt="kitkat" title="KITKAT">. 
                        Just be sure that you wear a costume that allows you to see clearly.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take an adult with you to help you cross the <img src="" alt="rockyroad" title="ROCKYROAD">. 
                        Perhaps your <img src="" alt="sugardaddy" title="SUGARDADDY"> will come along.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Be polite, don't act like <img src="" alt="nerds" title="NERDS"> and drive people <img src="" alt="bonkers" title="BONKERS">. 
                        Be a little <img src="" alt="sweetharts" title="SWEETHARTS"> and say "thank you."
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take a flashlight along to light your <img src="" alt="milkyway" title="MILKYWAY"> 
                        then you won't fall and <img src="" alt="crunch" title="CRUNCH"> or <img src="" alt="krackel" title="KRACKEL"> your
                        body into 100 <img src="" alt="grand" title="GRAND"> pieces.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you have finally arrived back home with all your loot, you will realize you have had a big
                        PAYDAY. You will be in a state of complete <img src="" alt="almondjay" title="ALMONDJAY">. 
                        Before you eat your goodies, have a <img src="" alt="bighunk" title="BIGHUNK"> of an adult check your treats.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p><img src="" alt="hugs" title="HUGS"> AND <img src="" alt="kisses" title="KISSES"></p>
                <p>The great <img src="" alt="pumpkin" title="PUMPKIN"></p>
